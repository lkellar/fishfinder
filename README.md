# Fish Finder

The fastest way to locate dining hall fish at the University of Michigan
---
## Setup

Just clone, `pipenv install`, then run `python3 -m src.generate` (or something similar). It should create `index.html` in the `out` directory.

I would reccomend just pointing to the out folder, and the running `generate.py` every once in a while (maybe hourly)

Checks up to 15 days into the future.
